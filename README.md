- 👋 Hi, I’m @canukaus. I'm a bored retiree who is interested in learning Prolog, and also to get a sense of how AI programs are developed.
- 👀 I’m interested in Prolog and Python (I haven't looked at Python for at least a decade. It seems to have expanded considerbly since I last dabbled in it).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Prolog
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source applications sometime in the future (maybe) - when and if I develop the required skills and knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me at: bill_paterson2019@outlook.com
